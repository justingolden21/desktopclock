always on top mode is not possible. write about this in FAQs or help, and then mention ways of doing this on different operating systems.

bugs:
home theme buttons do not function
pinpoint seconds in analog/digital time
pwa auto update (fixed?)
dbl click on btn shouldnt toggle fullscreen
after changing night mode inside the settings modal, then closing and opening the modal, the toggle switches inside the same section toggle night mode...
night mode error page is not readable

features:
use system default for night mode (dropdown with night off, on, or system)

visual bugs:
close icon in modals not showing
battery fill when charging in night mode doesn't turn unfilled part dark (transparent)

development bugs:
fix auto format for hooks.js

tmp bug fixes:
nav links are underline despite styless.css
    cause: npm run dev has :not(nav a) but npm run prod has :not(nava)
    tried: changing to :not(nav), but links are not affected
    possible solutions: parent-child selectors such as > or +
    solution: nav a:hover {text-decoration: none}

performance:

maybe:
nav: click away or esc to close nav?
different face appearance for night mode settings
more reset btns accross settings tabs/pannels

notes:
changing the face fill to transparent (-1) will disable the shadow fill and shadow input
node -v is 14.17.5
