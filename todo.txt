btns for reset some settings, btn for reset all

! auto detect night mode

! numbers for colors not auto filling correctly

zen mode btn: top of clock settings, click to go fullscreen, no menu, no buttons, no title, just primary and secondary display

custom scrollbar?

presentation api todo:
make the receiver a page that just has the clock with no menu or buttons, and then the user can change the settings and it sends a signal to the receiver to display those changes on the tv. eventually will want to support worldclock etc


remember which tab and accordion are open in settings?

next:
analog settings aren't populating select correctly
timezones
local storage settings
test casting api
keyboard shortcuts
make it load cleaner
fix details open/close
make clock leftmost tab in settings?
add more icons to settings?
default time format with timezone?
simple ui for datetime locale, language, and timezone, with auto detect and reset options
move this branch to prod
fix theme btn display
check meta tags, make sure it works on google,fb,twitter, etc, maybe add similar to sharethis?
https://metatags.io/

preset buttons that you click for specific settings/modes, for example, "swim clock" which has mins and sec only
ability to have multiple timers/countdowns in 3hrs/3years, name them, delete them, share them (url params)

preset themes (choose from maybe five or ten, preview images or clocks maybe?)
save your own themes and load them?

live update clock preview in settings on static float right when changing analog display settings?

future:
timezone input with autocomplete select
primary or secondary input: timezone (name, location, utc... pick which ones), greeting ("good morning/afternoon/evening/night, {name}!"), custom (custom text)
test presentation, share, and pwa
calendar page
flutter mobile apps, port to watch and tv

settings ui:
change help to about, move modal three
application tab should use details
settings modal should remember which tab and accordion is open
accordions should have a > v icon for open/closed
clock should be leftmost
tabs could have icons
general tab could be appearance only, renamed appearance, move shortcuts to application
version number should be moved from applicaiton to about. way to automatically update each commit?
btn below appearance settings to reset appearance settings
btn below all clock settings to reset all 3 (displays, analog, digital)
all 3 locale settings should have reset btns next to them and auto detect toggles next to them
download and upload settings (json, human readable) should be in advanced settings? maybe not
rename reset settings btn to reset ALL settings, maybe even add confirmation prompt?
save old settings and add btn to undo/go back to those settings?
some btns could use icons next to them?
reorder/reorganize btns in application > app, rename "app"
newline before reference table btn, only show btn if custom is selected in a dropdown

https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/presentation-api/
icon ideas: present, tv, cast, chromecast, projector, arrow, external link

themes:
reset display settings/theme btn
other theme defaults, save theme profiles
export and share themes

dev setup:
extrapolate battery component, analog clock

searchable settings? (search bar on modal title area)

setting to always have menu collapsed (even on large screens)

setting to hide title bar after time (10s, etc) of inactivity, mouse move to make it reappear

ux:
monospace/fix kerning for numbers in time so they do not shift
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10149330/force-non-monospace-font-into-fixed-width-using-css
! make page load less ugly

reset settings btn, save settings to browser local storage
let user chose primary and secondary color/palette, also chose specific color for hands, ticks, etc

fix time off on awake bug
pwa install btn if not installed
add modal component, add settings modal with layout
add i18n
organize js, use imports / exports
implement settings
add animate.css
animated icons / icon animations
add tabs and accordion components, toggle, toast
add fonts offline
change increment script from python to node
store fonts offline

more settings:
tick hands
flip clock for digital time
font choices
save time history in stopwatch
install pwa prompt button
show battery, internet strength, weather, link to spotify options
modal for steps to add to taskbar, apps, mobile, etc for each os with details/summary

later:
store settings in localstorage
music playback options secondary display with spotify (p/p, ff, rw, song and artist name)
displays.js: implement format options, locale options
always on top mode is not possible. write about this in FAQs or help, and then mention ways of doing this on different operating systems.

bugs:
home theme buttons do not function
pinpoint seconds in analog/digital time
pwa auto update (fixed?)
dbl click on btn shouldnt toggle fullscreen
after changing night mode inside the settings modal, then closing and opening the modal, the toggle switches inside the same section toggle night mode...
night mode error page is not readable

not bugs (hydration issues, fixed in build/preview)
install btn disappears when changing to night mode?

needs testing:
casting
pwa, auto update, offline

features:
use system default for night mode (dropdown with night off, on, or system)

visual bugs:
close icon in modals not showing
battery fill when charging in night mode doesn't turn unfilled part dark (transparent)

development bugs:
fix auto format for hooks.js

tmp bug fixes:
nav links are underline despite styless.css
    cause: npm run dev has :not(nav a) but npm run prod has :not(nava)
    tried: changing to :not(nav), but links are not affected
    possible solutions: parent-child selectors such as > or +
    solution: nav a:hover {text-decoration: none}

performance:

maybe:
ability to turn off setting to live preview time format in dropdown (advanced setting?)
font weight options? slider?
titles for icon buttons, maybe tooltips, should be translated
give them option to swap order of date and time?
nav: click away or esc to close nav?
different face appearance for night mode settings
more reset btns accross settings tabs/pannels
documents.fonts.entries() and give user choice of any font on their system
binary clock option? Two or three rows for hrs, mins, sec

notes:
changing the face fill to transparent (-1) will disable the shadow fill and shadow input
node -v is 14.17.5

get user geolocation (browser asks them)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API/Using_the_Geolocation_API#watching_the_current_position

});
