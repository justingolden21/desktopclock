not bugs (hydration issues, fixed in build/preview)
install btn disappears when changing to night mode?

tmp bug fixes:
nav links are underline despite styless.css
    cause: npm run dev has :not(nav a) but npm run prod has :not(nava)
    tried: changing to :not(nav), but links are not affected
    possible solutions: parent-child selectors such as > or +
    solution: nav a:hover {text-decoration: none}

maybe:
nav: click away or esc to close nav?
nah: different face appearance for night mode settings
documents.fonts.entries() and give user choice of any font on their system

dev warnings: unused css selectors in nav
warnings are because no <a> are in nav, will be fixed with new items
can add:
<a class="active hidden" href="#test">test</a>
but this will be fixed in future anyway, and hidden class is overriden by <a> styling, so not worth the effort when this will be fixed in future
