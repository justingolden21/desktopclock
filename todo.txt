visual bugs:

development bugs:
fix auto format for hooks.js

tmp bug fixes:
nav links are underline despite styless.css
    cause: npm run dev has :not(nav a) but npm run prod has :not(nava)
    tried: changing to :not(nav), but links are not affected
    possible solutions: parent-child selectors such as > or +
    solution: nav a:hover {text-decoration: none}

performance:

maybe:
nav: click away or esc to close nav?

notes:
changing the face fill to transparent (-1) will disable the shadow fill and shadow input
node -v is 14.17.5
