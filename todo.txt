presentation api todo:
make the receiver a page that just has the clock with no menu or buttons, and then the user can change the settings and it sends a signal to the receiver to display those changes on the tv. eventually will want to support worldclock etc

btn to add new theme, new theme shows up as btn with small x to right to delete it
prompt "are you sure" before deleting, max of 20 themes, btn to delete all themes appears if more than 5

! pwa initial screen and offline not working, website not working in messenger
! remember which tab and accordion are open in settings
! add icons to more btns
! interior modal full width (formatting table, eventually view shortcuts modal) move modal outside of settings modal (settings component)
 - settings component could include modal wrapper
! use theme in more places (replace "gray" with the theme color, maybe later have an accent)
! implement remaining settings:
- send feedback can open modal prompt with subject and body and send btn opens mailto
- implenent langs, locales, timezones, update ui with reset btns next to them and auto detect toggle
- finalize keyboard shortcuts, view keyboard shortcuts modal (maybe turn on and off specific shortcuts, change keys (each item has a toggle and input for key))

settings ui:

https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/presentation-api/
icon ideas: present, tv, cast, chromecast, projector, arrow, external link

themes:
reset display settings/theme btn
other theme defaults, save theme profiles
export and share themes

dev setup:
extrapolate battery component, analog clock

searchable settings? (search bar on modal title area)

setting to hide title bar after time (10s, etc) of inactivity, mouse move to make it reappear

ux:
monospace/fix kerning for numbers in time so they do not shift
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10149330/force-non-monospace-font-into-fixed-width-using-css

reset settings btn, save settings to browser local storage
let user chose primary and secondary color/palette, also chose specific color for hands, ticks, etc

add i18n
add animate.css
animated icons / icon animations
add fonts offline

more settings:
tick hands
flip clock for digital time
save time history in stopwatch (can print, share, download, etc)
show internet strength, weather, link to spotify options
modal for steps to add to taskbar, apps, mobile, etc for each os with details/summary

later:

always on top mode is not possible. write about this in FAQs or help, and then mention ways of doing this on different operating systems.
dark mode styles for <table>

bugs:
home theme buttons do not function
pinpoint seconds in analog/digital time
pwa auto update (fixed?)
dbl click on btn shouldnt toggle fullscreen

not bugs (hydration issues, fixed in build/preview)
install btn disappears when changing to night mode?

needs testing:
casting
pwa, auto update, offline

visual bugs:
close icon in modals not showing
battery fill when charging in night mode doesn't turn unfilled part dark (transparent)

development bugs:
fix auto format for hooks.js

tmp bug fixes:
nav links are underline despite styless.css
    cause: npm run dev has :not(nav a) but npm run prod has :not(nava)
    tried: changing to :not(nav), but links are not affected
    possible solutions: parent-child selectors such as > or +
    solution: nav a:hover {text-decoration: none}

performance:

maybe:
ability to turn off setting to live preview time format in dropdown (advanced setting?)
font weight options? slider? dropdown?
titles for icon buttons, maybe tooltips, should be translated
give them option to swap order of date and time?
nav: click away or esc to close nav?
different face appearance for night mode settings
more reset btns accross settings tabs/pannels
documents.fonts.entries() and give user choice of any font on their system
binary clock option? Two or three rows for hrs, mins, sec

notes:
changing the face fill to transparent (-1) will disable the shadow fill and shadow input
